<h1>Why, you ask?</h1>
<span class="center" style="text-align:center; background-color:#999999">
This website was created in order to captivate the many minds of the world. 
<br> To motivate. 
<br> To inspire. 
<br>
<br> Not just everyone can simply comprehend what has been created here today.
<br> We are sophisticated beings who can truely look below the surface. 
<br> I created this place to track down the true geniuses within our society.
<br>
<br> The questions below may just help you understand why I have decided to create this here website.
</span>

<h1>What do you study?</h1>
<span class="center" style="text-align:center; background-color:#999999">
I am a sophisticated gentleman.
<br> I study Further Mathematics.
<br> This math is not something everyone can simply comprehend.
<br> Some of you shall never understand the meaning of i.
<br> <br> My calculator of choice is the Casio fx-CG50.
<br> It has a graphing function which enables me to quickly check my solutions.
</span>

<h1>What is your favourite puzzle game?</h1>
<span class="center" style="text-align:center; background-color:#999999">
I play Tetris, the most supreme of all puzzle games.
<br> The tetrominoes fall from the top of the screen, and land on the bottom.
<br> I cannot remember the last time in which I did not achieve a Tetris, if ever.
<br>
<br> Some of you may not understand what is the greatness of Tetris.
<br> It is akin to the complexity of Quantum Physics - of course you won't.
<br> You simpletons may not even understand what you are reading right now, regardless of how many photons may enter your iris.
<br> Oh well, as expected.
</span>

<h1>What is your favourite TV show?</h1>
<span class="center" style="text-align:center; background-color:#999999">
<b>Rick and Morty.</b>
<br> Some of you may believe Rick and Morty is a <i>"child's show"</i>. Oh, how you are wrong.
<br> You have to have a <b>very high IQ</b> to understand Rick and Morty. 
<br> The humor is <i>extremely</i> subtle, and without a solid grasp of <b>theoretical physics</b> most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. 
<br> There's also Rick's <i>nihilistic</i> outlook, which is <i>deftly</i> woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. 
<br> The fans understand this; <i>they have the <b>intellectual</b> capacity to truly appreciate</i> the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about <b><i>LIFE.</b></i> 
<br> As a consequence people who <b>dislike</b> Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- <i>of course they wouldn't appreciate</i>, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase <i>"Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"</i> which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.
<br> I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those <i>addlepated simpletons</i> scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. 
<br> <i>What fools... how I pity them. </i>
<br>
<br> And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. 
<br> And no, you cannot see it. <i>It's for the ladies' eyes only</i>- And even they have to demonstrate that they're <b>within</b> 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
