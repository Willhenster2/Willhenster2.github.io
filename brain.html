<h2>Why?</h2>
I created this website to track down a specific group in our society.
<br> An underrated group.
<br> A group which can understand what the other pages could mean.
<br> Not just everyone can simply comprehend what has been created here today.
<br> 
<b>
<br> This website is a secret IQ test. 
<br> I am looking for the bottom 1% of humans.
<br> A score of less than 65.
</b>
<br>
<br> This website is built to not only track down said group, but to lower your IQ too.
<br> All visitors of this website have shown signs of losing up to 90% of brain cells immediately, <b>massively decreasing IQ</b>.
<br>
<br> The questions below may just help you understand why I have decided to create this website.

<h2>What do you want this group of people?</h2>
These people can see something unique in everything.
<br> These people will be the next great innovators, of nothing.
<br> <i> We need more low IQ humans in our society. </i>
<br>
<br> <b> We need them to run everything. </b>
<br> Our current world with an average IQ of 100 is far too complicated.
<br> Human kind is progressing far too quickly.
<br>
<br> Imagine a world where we are all too daft for politics.
<br> Imagine a world where everyone is trash in games - making Blizzard matchmaking valid.
<br>
<br> I am looking to recruit the fellows who agree with this cause into Densa.

<h2>What is Densa?</h2>
Densa is a society comprising of the lowest of all human IQs.
<br> <i>We are here to rival Mensa by inverting their beliefs</i>.
<br> If that society is exclusive to the top 2%, so we are exclusive to the <b>bottom 2%</b>.
<br> However, we are better than them as <b>you can lower your IQ</b> by spending even more time on this website.
<br>
<br> Our entire society is built around reaching the lowest potential a human possibly can.
<br> Everything you learnt in school is to be thrown out, and if it cannot be, it is to be misused in the worst possible manner.
<br>
<br> An example of this is the pages prior - I cannot simply forget how to program, however I can be incredibly daft in doing so, removing brain cells from those who visit and myself in the process. 

<h2>What is the science here?</h2>
There is no such thing as science.
<br> We do not believe in such silly things.
<br>
<br> <b>Here are our 6 core beliefs</b>;
<span style="text-align:left">
<br> - hot dogs are a burger.
<br> - monkeys are supreme to humans.
<br> - humans should abandon language and use screaming instead. for example; 
<button onclick="playsound()">future language</button>
<br> - coronavirus is a conspiracy made up by the toilet paper companies to sell more toilet paper
<br> - water companies are putting chemicals in the water that is turning the frogs homosexual
<br> - opinion is always fact
